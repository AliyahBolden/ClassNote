            <h2>Working With CSS In Your HTML File</h2>
            <p>Working with CSS is a great way to style things in your HTML respectively. It also helps with organization and clarity. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Which basically means changing the style of your HTML. You can have CSS in your HTML file, or a link to another file strictly for CSS. Today we will be working on CSS in the HTML file.</p>

            <br><br>
            <p>You can basically do what we did last class in a more organized way using CSS. It's very easy to use! The basic structure of it is:</p>
                   <iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://jsfiddle.net/AliyahBolden/74ccfkrb/1/embedded/css/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
            
<br><br>
            Here is a good page of different types of tags and selectors we can use, I'll be going down the list and showing a few of the basic ones that we will use, but if you want a challange and to play around with these selectors you may! Click <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp">here.</a> This is specifically for CSS.<br><br><br>
            
            <h2>Working With Divs</h2>
            <p>A div stands for division. The div tag defines a section in an html document. You can use divs as well to section off your HTML and organize them. You can also give divs names for better organization and structure. Here's an example.</p><br>
            
                       <iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://jsfiddle.net/AliyahBolden/3oneb47k/1/embedded/html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
                                   <iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://jsfiddle.net/AliyahBolden/3oneb47k/1/embedded/css/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
                                   <iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://jsfiddle.net/AliyahBolden/3oneb47k/1/embedded/result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe> <br><br>
            <p>Basically what's going on in that DIV is that whatever is inside, is changing the text color to red. You can use the properties I spoke of before to edit this.</p><br>
            <p>Divs are usually also used to make boxes, add padding and margins and things like that. But there are a few specifics that we must know before we go on to this.</p>
            <p>There are two types of Div's. Div ID's and Div Classes. Div ID's are set divs that can only be used ONCE. These are specified in CSS by using a '#'. For example, you can use this for a navigation, or a title of the webpage that will only be used once! Div Classes can be used multiple times, and are specified in CSS using a '.' YOU CANNOT START AN ID OR A CLASS WITH A NUMBER!</p><br>
            
            <p>Another important thing you should know is the box model. The box model is how Div's are set up. Here's an image:</p>
            <img src="img/boxmodel.gif"><br><br>
            <p>So lets try to make our first box, add text, and style it. Lets make a box using some of the properties we spoke of earlier.</p><br><br>
