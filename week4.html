            <h2>Simple Bootstrap for Positioning</h2>
            <p>Bootstrap is a great tool for responsive web design and enabling someone to set up their items in rows and columns for organization and ease of access. The basic rule for bootstrap is each row must add up to 12 coloumns. No more than that but sometimes can be less depending on the situation. It's best to make sure it's 12. </p>
            <p>To start using bootstrap you MUST put this code in the beginning of each html file that uses bootstrap. This is needed so that the document knows to se bootstrap.</p><br><br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Now to start understanding bootstrap lets take a look at this link: <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid">here</a></p>
            
            <p>Basically with bootstrap it says "When the browser is small I want it to take up x amount of colums. When it is medium, I want it to take up x amount of colums" and so on.</p><br>
            <p>You can use this as a mini guide.</p>
                       <iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://jsfiddle.net/AliyahBolden/Lew7hnz7/embedded/html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
                                  <iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://jsfiddle.net/AliyahBolden/Lew7hnz7/embedded/result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            <p>Try the code above in your HTML editor in order to see the full length of the bootstrap responsiveness.</p>
        
            <h2>Relative Links vs Absolute Links</h2>
            <br>
            <p>With linking things to your page, it is really important on how you link things. Linking images, other html pages, and even downloaded videos from your flashdrive or folder, you'd use a Relative Link. A relative link is set up this way: </p>  <iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://jsfiddle.net/AliyahBolden/5kgtavtz/embedded/html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            <p>Linking things like other webpages, youtube videos, images off of tumblr and google, you'd use an Absolute link. Like this:</p>
            
            <iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://jsfiddle.net/AliyahBolden/85wLoxsk/embedded/html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
            <p>It's  better to work with Relative links because it will always be in the folder you save it in and will be available to you for links, where as Absolute links might disappear if the person who posts it deletes it off of their website and you'd be losing content right there. Sometimes it can't be helped, like using youtube or veoh links but with images, videos you've made or downloaded, and html files you can link them relatively.</p>
            <p><a href="http://www.coffeecup.com/help/articles/absolute-vs-relative-pathslinks/">Here will be how to link using relative and absolute.</a></p>
            <h2>Making Your Navigation</h2>
            <br>
            Making your navigation is the same as using Relative links. Just link all your pages in one place and call it a navigation. You should make the navigation it's own div, and should be used by making a list which I'll show you. Here is a basic setup of a list, using bootstrap as well.

                                   <iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://jsfiddle.net/AliyahBolden/c3az361e/2/embedded/result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            <h2>Styling Your Navigation</h2>
            <br>
            <p>When you put your navigation inside of a div, you can style it just like a box. You can also style the li and ul tags as well. The ol tag style will apply to the whole list entirely, while the li will style just each link. Let's practice!</p>
